        <!--This is the difference between Tags and attributes-->
        <h2>Tags and Attributes</h2>
        <p>Tags are used to define the structure of an HTML document. They are enclosed in angle brackets. Most tags must be opened and closed. The closing tag has a forward slash before the tag name.
             For example, the paragraph tag is written as <p> and the closing paragraph tag is written as </p>. 
             
             Attributes are used to provide additional information about an element.
              They are always included in the opening tag. 
              For example, the image tag has an attribute called src that specifies the image file to display.
         The image tag is written as.</p>
